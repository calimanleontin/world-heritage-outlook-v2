description: 'Mark benefits generated by the World Heritage site from the list provided as either "present" or "data deficient" (i.e. benefits that could reasonably be assumed to be present but for which there is little/no information). Benefits that are not marked are assumed to be absent. For each selected benefit, provide a brief summary, along with references wherever possible. Please include information on factors negatively affecting the provision of selected benefits where this is available (indicating the level of impact [Very High, High, Moderate, Low] and the trend [Increasing, Continuing, Decreasing]). Where no information on such factors is available, the fields can be left blank.'
