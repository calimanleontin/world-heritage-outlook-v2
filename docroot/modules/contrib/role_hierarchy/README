This module provides security features for platforms with a clear user role hierarchy. By enabling this module,
lower user roles will no longer be able to create, edit or delete users with more powerful roles.

To configure the role hierarchy, simply go to /admin/people/roles and order the roles, having the more powerful
roles first.
