description: 'Record references used in previous steps here. Please note, all information used in assessments needs to be referenced for transparency and so that future assessments can review the previous information base. Information sources must be clearly referenced within the Description column in the case of Step 1, and in the justification for assessment columns in Steps 2, 3 and 4. References should be listed alphabetically and follow the Harvard system, also known as the authorâ€“date system, which is structured as follows: author(s), date, title, place of publication, publisher (this is the standard IUCN format). Where possible, URLs for documents available online should be included.'
